# Security Notes: Smart Email Guardian

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, potential threats, and implemented mitigations for the Smart Email Guardian application. As a cybersecurity-focused tool, security is paramount in both the application's design and operation.

## Security Architecture

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

#### API Key Management
- **Implementation**: Token-based authentication using SHA-256 hashed API keys
- **Storage**: Keys are hashed before storage in SQLite database
- **Rotation**: Users can create multiple keys and deactivate old ones
- **Scope**: Each key is tied to specific user actions and rate limits

#### Access Control
- All sensitive endpoints require valid API key authentication
- Rate limiting implemented (100 requests/hour per IP)
- Request validation and sanitization on all inputs

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Email Content Processing
```python
# Input validation layers:
1. Content-Type validation
2. Size limits (50KB maximum)
3. Character encoding validation (UTF-8)
4. Script tag detection and rejection
5. SQL injection pattern filtering
```

#### Preprocessing Security
- **URL Sanitization**: All URLs replaced with `[URL]` placeholder
- **Email Masking**: Email addresses replaced with `[EMAIL]` placeholder  
- **Header Removal**: Email headers stripped to prevent header injection
- **Length Limiting**: Content truncated to prevent buffer overflow attacks

### üîí Data Protection

#### Privacy-First Design
- **No Email Storage**: Original email content is never stored
- **Hash-Only Logging**: Only SHA-256 hashes of email content stored for audit
- **Ephemeral Processing**: Email content exists only in memory during analysis
- **Secure Deletion**: Memory cleared after processing

#### Database Security
- **SQLite with WAL mode**: Prevents database corruption
- **Parameterized queries**: Prevents SQL injection attacks
- **Minimal permissions**: Database runs with minimal required permissions
- **No plaintext secrets**: All sensitive data is hashed or encrypted

### üåê Network Security

#### API Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All production traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict origin policies for web frontend
- **Request Size Limits**: Maximum payload size enforced
- **Timeout Controls**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

#### Development Security
- **Local Development**: Uses HTTP proxy for secure local testing
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between dev/staging/prod
- **Secret Management**: Environment variables for all sensitive configuration

## Threat Model & Mitigations

### üéØ Identified Threats

#### 1. Malicious Input Injection
**Threat**: Attackers attempt to inject malicious scripts or SQL commands
**Impact**: Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise
**Mitigation**:
- Strict input validation with regex patterns
- Content sanitization and escaping
- Script tag detection and rejection
- Parameterized database queries

#### 2. Denial of Service (DoS)
**Threat**: Resource exhaustion through excessive requests or large payloads
**Impact**: Service unavailability, server crash
**Mitigation**:
- Rate limiting (100 requests/hour per IP)
- Request size limits (50KB max)
- Processing timeouts (30 seconds max)
- Async processing to prevent blocking

#### 3. Data Privacy Breaches
**Threat**: Unauthorized access to sensitive email content
**Impact**: Privacy violation, data leakage
**Mitigation**:
- No persistent storage of email content
- Hash-only audit logging
- Memory clearing after processing
- API key-based access control

#### 4. Model Poisoning/Evasion
**Threat**: Crafted inputs designed to fool the AI model
**Impact**: Incorrect classifications, false negatives
**Mitigation**:
- Multiple detection layers (AI + patterns)
- Conservative classification thresholds
- Pattern-based fallback detection
- Confidence score reporting

#### 5. API Key Compromise
**Threat**: Stolen or leaked API keys used maliciously
**Impact**: Unauthorized service usage, resource abuse
**Mitigation**:
- Key hashing and secure storage
- Rate limiting per key
- Usage monitoring and alerts
- Easy key rotation/revocation

### üö® Attack Scenarios & Responses

#### Scenario 1: Mass Email Processing Attack
**Attack**: Attacker floods service with processing requests
**Detection**: Rate limit exceeded, unusual usage patterns
**Response**: 
- Automatic rate limiting kicks in
- API key temporarily suspended
- Monitoring alerts triggered

#### Scenario 2: Malicious Content Injection
**Attack**: Attacker submits email with embedded malicious scripts
**Detection**: Script tag patterns detected during validation
**Response**:
- Request rejected with 400 Bad Request
- Content sanitized if partially malicious
- Incident logged for analysis

#### Scenario 3: Model Evasion Attempt
**Attack**: Carefully crafted phishing email designed to bypass AI detection
**Detection**: Pattern-based backup detection triggers
**Response**:
- Multi-layer analysis provides additional coverage
- Confidence scores help users assess results
- Continuous pattern updates improve detection

## Security Best Practices

### üîß Development Security

#### Code Security
```bash
# Security linting and scanning
bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json
safety check --json --output safety-report.json
pip-audit --format=json --output=audit-report.json
```

#### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency principle (only essential packages)
- Pinned versions for reproducible builds
- Security-focused package selection

#### Testing Security
- Comprehensive security test suite
- Input fuzzing and edge case testing
- Performance and DoS resistance testing
- Regular penetration testing (manual)

### üöÄ Deployment Security

#### Production Hardening
```python
# Security headers for production
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY", 
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'"
}
```

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning (if using Docker)
- Minimal base images with security updates
- Network segmentation and firewall rules
- Regular security patching and updates
